# c_price = float(input("chal product ka cost price bta."))
# s_price = float(input(" And selling price bhi bata."))
# revenue_cost = s_price - c_price

#     print(f"you lost {revenue_cost}rs")
# else:
#     print(f"you are in profit and your profit is {revenue_cost}rs")
#     print("This is Sachin this side.")



     
 #  Question (11.) Write a program to find the simple interest when the value of principle,rate of interest and time period is given.

# S.I. = (P × R × T)/100,
principal = 100
rate = 1200
time = 60
simple_intrest = (principal * rate * time)/100

print(simple_intrest)
